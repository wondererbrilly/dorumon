
Photon Unity Networking
	This package is a re-implementation of Unity's Networking, using the Photon Cloud Service.
	Also included: a setup wizard, demo scene, documentation and editor extensions.


Integration
	This package adds a editor window:
	Menu -> Windows, Photon Unity Networking


Server
	Exit Games is running Photon as service. This is currently free of charge.
	The window "Photon Unity Networking" will help you setup an account.
	Within Exitgames Cloud, the server cannot be modified.
	Read more about it: http://www.exitgamescloud.com

	Alternatively, you can download the server SDK and run your own Photon Server.
	The SDK comes with a complete game logic (ready to run, like in Photon Cloud)
	but you also get the source code for the game logic to modify and extend it.
